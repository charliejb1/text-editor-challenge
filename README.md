 ## Description: 

In this project, a database named "JATE" is initialized. Jate is then checked if its object store exists or not and if not it is created. The database can then be modified with "readwrite" and also .put function (all within database.js)
'Readonly' and 'Getall' are then used for getting and reading the data. In the webpack config file javascript and css files and an html file is created that will include those. A custom service worker and a manifest file are also used with injectmanifest and webpackpwamanifest.
Stylesheets, scripts, and webworkers are cached within the src-sw file in a cache named "asset-cache". The install file allows for a button for installation to be used while clearing the prompt after installation.
